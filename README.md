## Overview

Here is a full-featured blog engine written with RedwoodJS. It includes:

* Listing all blog posts with first paragraph summaries and pagination (the homepage)
* Reading a single, full blog post
* Searching for blog posts by keyword
* Displaying all posts with a given tag
* Contact form
* Fully responsive at various viewport sizes

The admin includes:

* User authentication
* Create a new blog post with:
    * Title
    * Slug (URL)
    * Author
    * Body
    * Tags
    * Splash image
* Edit existing blog post
* Delete a blog post
* Mark a new post as a Draft and not display it live
* Publish a post live
* Unpublish a post (puts it back to DRAFT status)

On the tech side:

* Data stored in a SQL database (SQLite locally)
* User authentication using [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/)
* Image uploads and CDN via [Filestack](https://filestack.com)
* CSS styling via [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* Contact forms are handled by [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/redwoodjs/example-blog.git
    cd example-blog

Install dependencies:

    yarn install

Create a local SQLite database and seed it with a few blog posts:

    yarn redwood db up
    yarn redwood db seed

Now you should be able to start a development server:

    yarn redwood dev

Assuming everything worked, open a browser to http://localhost:8910 and you should
be seeing the homepage (similar to the screenshot above).

### Deployment

See the section on [Deployment](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/deployment) in the [Redwood Tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial).

#### Enabling Authentication

> We're working on supporting the `netlify dev` command properly with Redwood, which is required to use Netlify Identity in a local dev environment. The following instructions will not work until this fix is complete.

Copy the `.env.defaults` file to a new file `.env` and edit it, setting the `USE_AUTHENTICATION` variable to `true`.

#### Enabling Identity on Netlify

You'll need to create a new site on Netlify so that you can enable Identity and
give the Identity API Endpoint to your development instance of the blog.

If you don't have it already, install the Netlify CLI tools:

    yarn global add netlify-cli

Log in with your Netlify credentials:

    netlify login

Create a new site:

    netlify init --manual

Now you have two paths:

1. Find and link to the existing site you have deployed
2. Choose `Create & configure a new site`, choose which team to associate this new site with (if you have more than one). You can enter a `Site name` or just hit ENTER to get a random one. You can enter `n`
when asked if you want to continue.

Go to netlify.com and find your site. Click on the Identity link and the Enable Identity button:

Now copy and paste the API endpoint URL that's displayed once the screen refreshes:

![Netlify Identity URL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/67904521-d196d780-fb2b-11e9-9f17-f2f668d1d29e.png)

Back to your local development machine, head to http://localhost:8910/admin and you'll be prompted with the login popup. Enter the URL that you just copied and click **Set site's URL**:

The popup should refresh and now you'll see a login box. But, we don't have any users yet. Back over to Netlify, click the **Invite users** button and send yourself an invite:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/67904786-a9f43f00-fb2c-11e9-9a4a-ecc672dfab93.png)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/67904814-be383c00-fb2c-11e9-851a-89ccd652811f.png" width="400">

You'll get an email with a link to accept the invite. However, this link won't work: it's trying to go to the Netlify URL, which doesn't have a site on it yet. So after clicking the link and getting an error, change the URL to be http://localhost:8910 *but make sure to keep the invite token at the end*. For example, if you are sent to

    https://nostalgic-dijkstra-23eaba.netlify.com/#invite_token=8-TFgNesyzhIn8LnXv3

Rewrite that URL to:

    http://localhost:8910/#invite_token=8-TFgNesyzhIn8LnXv3

You should see the login popup with a password input to complete your account. Fill it in and submit and now you should get a message saying you are logged in. Head back to the admin http://localhost:8910/admin and you should have access (finally!)

#### Enabling Image Uploads

The blog uses an external service, [Filestack](https://filestack.com) to handle image
uploads. If you want to be able to upload images in local development you'll need to
create a free account at Filestack and copy the API key. You get 100 uploads per
month on their free account which should be plenty to test with.

Once you have logged into Filestack copy the API key shown at the top right of the dashboard:

![Filestack screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/67905641-40296480-fb2f-11e9-8f86-94fd6ddbb12d.png)

If you haven't already, copy the `.env.example` file in the root of the blog to a new
file named `.env`. Edit the `FILESTACK_API_KEY` variable to be equal to the one you
just copied. Save `.env` and restart your `yarn dev` process. Now when creating a
new blog post http://localhost:8910/admin/new you should see a filepicker towards the
bottom of the form:

![New post screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/67907861-9f3ea780-fb36-11e9-8bca-4e71c38d47e3.png)

## TODO

* Remove file picker if ENV var not set, with instructions for enabling
* Add instructions for enabling Authentication
* In public view don't include posts in Draft state
